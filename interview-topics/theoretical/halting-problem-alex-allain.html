One of the most interesting non-programming parts of computer science is the
study of what can (and cannot) be computed.  For instance, take the question,
"does this program complete?"  I.e., will it not go into an infinite loop.
How would you answer this question, given an arbitrary piece of code?  You
could try running it.  But what if it takes a long time?  How long are you
willing to wait?

  <br><br>
Think about whether there is a general solution to this problem -- a method
that you could apply to any piece of C code in order to demonstrate that it
will eventually come to a stop.
<br><br>
Let's say that you discovered such a solution.  It's a program that takes two
arguments: the code for a program, and its input.  This solution returns true
if the program halts on the given input, and false if the program runs
forever.  Let's call this program DOES-HALT.  We can use DOES-HALT as
follows: 

<pre class="example">DOES-HALT(program, input)
</pre>

<br><br>
Now, given DOES-HALT, let's see what kinds of cool things we can do.  Well, we
can pass in the code of any program that's been running for a long time and
ensure that it's working.  This could certainly prove useful for complex
programs implementing a great deal of recursion or with complicated loop
conditions.

<br><br>
We could also use DOES-HALT to quickly compute whether or not a program passes
its test cases.  This is a little bit trickier.  How could we use DOES-HALT to
determine if a program produces the correct output for a specific input?  Keep
in mind that DOES-HALT does just that -- it halts.  So what if we constructed
a second program, let's call it COMPARE-OUTPUT, that would take three
arguments: a program, the input to the program, and the expected output.
Here's the key: COMPARE-OUTPUT will halt when the output of the program is the
same as the expected output, and it will go into an infinite loop otherwise.
Now, all we need to do is run DOES-HALT(COMPARE-OUTPUT, [program, input,
expected output]) to know whether or not program passes the test case, input,
and outputs the expected output.  If it halts, well, it does; otherwise, it
doesn't!

<br><br>
Think of the time such a program might save us for testing complex algorithms!

<br><br>
Let's look at some of the other consequences.  In particular, what if we
decided we wanted to write a program that would test what happens when we run
a program on itself as input.  For instance, the *nix program cat, when run on
itself, would output the binary executable file.  Some programs might never
halt when run on themselves, though -- so let's use DOES-HALT to write
pseudo-code for a program that checks to see what happens when a program is
given itself as input.  let's call it SELF-HALT, and SELF-HALT will halt if
the input program would *not* halt on itself. 

<pre class="example">SELF-HALT(program)
{
    if(DOES-HALT(program, program))
        infinite loop
    else
        halt
}
</pre>
This code is pretty straightforward: if the program would halt on itself,
then SELF-HALT goes into an infinite loop.  Otherwise, it halts.
<br><br>
This is pretty nifty because we can use it to tell whether a program that is
designed to analyze other programs (for instance, DOES-HALT) will actually
halt when given itself as input.
<br><br>
In fact, what if we use SELF-HALT to analyze itself?  Well, let's see.
SELF-HALT(SELF-HALT) should loop forever if DOES-HALT(SELF-HALT, SELF-HALT).
So if SELF-HALT halts on itself, it should loop forever.
<br><br>
That doesn't make sense, so DOES-HALT(SELF-HALT, SELF-HALT) must be false.
SELF-HALT(SELF-HALT) must not halt.  But if DOES-HALT(SELF-HALT, SELF-HALT) is
false, SELF-HALT(SELF-HALT) must halt!  A contradiction.
<br><br>
So where does this leave us?  There's nothing inherently wrong with our
SELF-HALT program; its structure is just fine.  Everything we pass as
an argument is perfectly reasonable as well.  In fact, the only thing that looks
at all questionable is this DOES-HALT program we've been using.
<br><br>
In fact, the above argument is essentially a proof that the halting problem,
as it is termed, cannot be solved in the general case.  No DOES-HALT program
exists.  If it did, we would be able to generate contradictions such as the
above -- a program that halts when it should loop forever, and that loops
forever when it halts.
