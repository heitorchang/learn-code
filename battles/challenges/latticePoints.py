def factorint(n, limit=None, use_trial=True, use_rho=True, use_pm1=True,
              verbose=False, visual=None):
    r"""
    Given a positive integer ``n``, ``factorint(n)`` returns a dict containing
    the prime factors of ``n`` as keys and their respective multiplicities
    as values. For example:

    >>> from sympy.ntheory import factorint
    >>> factorint(2000)    # 2000 = (2**4) * (5**3)
    {2: 4, 5: 3}
    >>> factorint(65537)   # This number is prime
    {65537: 1}

    For input less than 2, factorint behaves as follows:

        - ``factorint(1)`` returns the empty factorization, ``{}``
        - ``factorint(0)`` returns ``{0:1}``
        - ``factorint(-n)`` adds ``-1:1`` to the factors and then factors ``n``

    Partial Factorization:

    If ``limit`` (> 3) is specified, the search is stopped after performing
    trial division up to (and including) the limit (or taking a
    corresponding number of rho/p-1 steps). This is useful if one has
    a large number and only is interested in finding small factors (if
    any). Note that setting a limit does not prevent larger factors
    from being found early; it simply means that the largest factor may
    be composite. Since checking for perfect power is relatively cheap, it is
    done regardless of the limit setting.

    This number, for example, has two small factors and a huge
    semi-prime factor that cannot be reduced easily:

    >>> from sympy.ntheory import isprime
    >>> from sympy.core.compatibility import long
    >>> a = 1407633717262338957430697921446883
    >>> f = factorint(a, limit=10000)
    >>> f == {991: 1, long(202916782076162456022877024859): 1, 7: 1}
    True
    >>> isprime(max(f))
    False

    This number has a small factor and a residual perfect power whose
    base is greater than the limit:

    >>> factorint(3*101**7, limit=5)
    {3: 1, 101: 7}

    Visual Factorization:

    If ``visual`` is set to ``True``, then it will return a visual
    factorization of the integer.  For example:

    >>> from sympy import pprint
    >>> pprint(factorint(4200, visual=True))
     3  1  2  1
    2 *3 *5 *7

    Note that this is achieved by using the evaluate=False flag in Mul
    and Pow. If you do other manipulations with an expression where
    evaluate=False, it may evaluate.  Therefore, you should use the
    visual option only for visualization, and use the normal dictionary
    returned by visual=False if you want to perform operations on the
    factors.

    You can easily switch between the two forms by sending them back to
    factorint:

    >>> from sympy import Mul, Pow
    >>> regular = factorint(1764); regular
    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}
    >>> pprint(factorint(regular))
     2  2  2
    2 *3 *7

    >>> visual = factorint(1764, visual=True); pprint(visual)
     2  2  2
    2 *3 *7
    >>> print(factorint(visual))
    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}

    If you want to send a number to be factored in a partially factored form
    you can do so with a dictionary or unevaluated expression:

    >>> factorint(factorint({4: 2, 12: 3})) # twice to toggle to dict form
    {2: 10, 3: 3}
    >>> factorint(Mul(4, 12, evaluate=False))
    {2: 4, 3: 1}

    The table of the output logic is:

        ====== ====== ======= =======
                       Visual
        ------ ----------------------
        Input  True   False   other
        ====== ====== ======= =======

    Notes
    =====

    Algorithm:

    The function switches between multiple algorithms. Trial division
    quickly finds small factors (of the order 1-5 digits), and finds
    all large factors if given enough time. The Pollard rho and p-1
    algorithms are used to find large factors ahead of time; they
    will often find factors of the order of 10 digits within a few
    seconds:

    >>> factors = factorint(12345678910111213141516)
    >>> for base, exp in sorted(factors.items()):
    ...     print('%s %s' % (base, exp))
    ...
    2 2
    2507191691 1
    1231026625769 1

    Any of these methods can optionally be disabled with the following
    boolean parameters:

        - ``use_trial``: Toggle use of trial division
        - ``use_rho``: Toggle use of Pollard's rho method
        - ``use_pm1``: Toggle use of Pollard's p-1 method

    ``factorint`` also periodically checks if the remaining part is
    a prime number or a perfect power, and in those cases stops.


    If ``verbose`` is set to ``True``, detailed progress is printed.
