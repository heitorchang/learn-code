description = """
Your uncle is helping your precious, precocious 2-year-old cousin learn Algebra and though she still hasn't learned her *ABCs*, she is sharp with arithmetic and can quickly identify smiley faces, fruits, vegetables, and animals.

Your uncle's Algebra isn't as good as hers, so he asked you to help him by coding a solver to double-check your cousin's work.

Each test case will be given as an array of strings, where each string is a linear equation in the format

`#️⃣ 😊` &plusmn; `#️⃣ 😎` &plusmn; `#️⃣ 😫 = #️⃣`

where #️⃣ is an integer, and each smiley face is an arbitrary emoji. It is guaranteed that in a single string, all emojis are unique.
