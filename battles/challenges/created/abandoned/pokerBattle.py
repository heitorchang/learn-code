idea from Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories

given a stack of cards (0-9), find the quickest sequence of plays to defeat the enemy of n hit points.

skipping a card pushes it into a temporary stack

playing a single card deals 1 HP damage

once all cards are exhausted, the temporary stack becomes active.

2 cards: pair (you cannot play the "two pair" combination)
3 cards: three of a kind
4 cards: four of a kind

5 cards: straight (cards picked do not have to be in order)
5 cards: full house
