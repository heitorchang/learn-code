Title: How to Create a Private Challenge

From the Main Menu at the top-left, go to Challenges, then at the right, click the blue link **+ CREATE** to take you to the **Task Library** page.

First, click the big dashed box with the plus sign labeled **"Create New"**. You will fill in the form above later, when assigning the new task you are about to write to a new Challenge.

Now, you will be at the *create-task* page. Even after your challenge is created, the corresponding task may be edited.

A task has these components:

* Name
* Description
* List of inputs
* Output

You must define the type of inputs and output. Test cases must conform to your choice of types.

At the bottom right, you must write at least three test cases. The first half (rounded up) will be visible to solvers, and the rest, hidden.

You are not required to write a solution for your task.

Once you are done, click on **SAVE ALL** at the bottom-right.

Finally, click on **DONE** at the top-right. You should now see the new task in the **Task Library** page.

Now, choose the challenge settings in the form at the top. "Shortest solution" encourages golfing, while "Highest score" may be used for heavy optimization tasks, for example (where a suboptimal solution only solves part of the hidden tests).

The duration is recommended to be **7 days**. At the end of this period, everyone's solutions will become visible.

Finally, click the teal **CREATE CHALLENGE** button at the top-right, and save the given URL.

So far I have not seen this URL become available anywhere after you leave the page. However, you may create a brand-new challenge using the new task. The task should remain accessible from the **Task Library** page.

To edit your task later on, go to the Challenges' **+ CREATE** menu, click on **VIEW TASK**, and on the next page, click the three dots at the bottom-right, next to the thumbs up and down votes.
