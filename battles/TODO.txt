minimal Coin problem, greedy vs. dynamic programming

trouble solving removeDuplicateAdjacent (remove all consecutive letters, not leaving a single one)

trouble solving Excel column number to String: "Z" is a weird edge case that should have been zero, but is actually 26.
If the remainder (n % 26) equals zero, replace it by 26 and subtract 26 from the overall number

Question: Consider a piece of straw with a length of strawLength. You want to break it into smaller pieces with pairwise distinct positive integer lengths. What is the maximum possible number of smaller pieces that you can get from breaking the original piece?

Answer by RJ_L1: return (int(sqrt(1 + 8*length)) - 1) // 2
