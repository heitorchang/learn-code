description = """
Given a decimal integer n, find an integer k â‰¥ 2 such that the representation of n in base k has the maximum possible number of zeros. If there are several answers, output the smallest one.

Example

For n = 9, the output should be
maxZeros(n) = 2.
9 = 10012 = 1003 = 214...
If you'll try all other bases, you'll see that the maximum possible number of zeros in these representations is 2, thus the answer is k = 2.
