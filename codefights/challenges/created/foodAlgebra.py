Your niece Lucca loves math, and knows the entire multiplication table up to a hundred by heart. However, she still hasn't learned her ABCs.

She wrote an algebraic puzzle for you, consisting of three equations made up of fruits, vegetables and integers.

Each of the first three (visible) tests represents a single equation, where the input is the left side of the equation, and the output is the right side. The equals sign is implicit.

The three hidden tests correspond to (in an arbitrary order, because the test checker runs them in a random order)

```
= ???
= ???
= ???
```

Your task is to determine the value of each fruit or vegetable, in order to pass the hidden tests as shown above.
