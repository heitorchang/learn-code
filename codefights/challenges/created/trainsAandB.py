At 12:04 PM, you hijacked **Train B**, traveling West, which contains a gigantic 2,000 kg gold bar. You only have a nail file with you, allowing you to file away 1 gram of gold dust per minute.

Also at 12:04 PM, a train controller accidentally activated a rail switch that sent **Train A**, traveling East, full of C-4 plastic explosives, to collide with Train B.

Just before the trains collide, you will jump off with as much gold dust as you can.

Given the distance between Trains A and B at 12:04 PM (in kilometers) and the speeds of both trains (in kilometers per hour), return the maximal amount of gold dust you can have **(rounded down to the nearest gram)** and staying alive. The train speeds remain constant throughout.
