You are cramming for an exam

You are so desperate to do your best that you have acquired a bottle of an experimental nanotech mind-concentration drug.

You start off by taking the single red pill. You are asked to write down the exact time you took it (you have a correctly set digital clock)

You have to take the remaining pills one after another within 7 minutes of each other or the magic will be totally gone.

After taking a pill, its effects depend on the ones' digit of the clock (the rightmost digit)
