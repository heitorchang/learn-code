Naturally-occurring inorganic materials often exhibit [rotational symmetry](https://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/eens211/introsymmetry.htm).

You have an electron microscope image of a sample and wish to know whether it exhibits 2-fold (where a 180&deg; rotation about an axis perpendicular to the image will result in the same image) or 4-fold symmetry (in this case, a 90&deg; rotation).

Because 180&deg; is a multiple of 90&deg;, an object with 4-fold symmetry will also have 2-fold symmetry.
