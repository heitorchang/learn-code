# Idea: there are multiple "containers" with bacteria. you need to kill all of them

# you have different chemicals with different effects, like kill 1/2. every turn a container is not attacked, its bacteria multiply (by a percentage)

# figure out how many turns (or attacks) you need to kill all bacteria
