# Idea: there are multiple "containers" with bacteria. you need to kill all of them

# you have different medicine with different effects, like kill 1/2. remove 10, every turn a container is not attacked, its bacteria multiply (by a percentage)

# given a stack of medicines (they must be used in order), figure out how many turns (or attacks) you need to kill all bacteria, or return -1 if it is not possible to win

# Types of medicines

## Halviene (cuts bacteria population to p // 2 + 1, for example, 11 -> 6)

## Precisene-100 (kills exactly 100 bacteria)

## Freezene (prevents bacteria from multiplying for that turn)
