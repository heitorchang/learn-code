description = """
You have a 2D binary matrix that's filled with 0s and 1s. In the matrix, find the largest square that contains only 1s and return its area.

Example

For

matrix = [
    ['1', '0', '1', '1', '1'],
    ['1', '0', '1', '1', '1'],
    ['1', '1', '1', '1', '1'],
    ['1', '0', '0', '1', '0'],
    ['1', '0', '0', '1', '0']
]
the output should be
maximalSquare(matrix) = 9.

Input/Output

[time limit] 4000ms (py3)
[input] array.array.char matrix

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ matrix.length ≤ 100,
1 ≤ matrix[i].length ≤ 100,
0 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 1.

[output] integer

An integer that represents the area of the largest square in the given matrix that is composed only of 1s.
