* T-shirts

In this post, which I think was the most recent one about shirts, [Announcement Regarding Coins, Items and T-shirts](https://app.codesignal.com/forum/hmLhmmqyvaWre2JoJ), the admin wrote,

```
we will keep the store alive for the U.S. users who signed up
on our site prior to August 24, 2018. As we've announced
previously, the store has been unavailable for all non-US
users who've signed up prior to July 30, 2017, and it will
remain that way.
